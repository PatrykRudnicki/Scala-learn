//Some important points to note :-

//When implementing lazy loading caches like the cache variable above, we can use either a val referring to a mutable Map or a var referring to an immutable Map. The reason I prefer the latter is because even if we accidentally pass the reference around, the map it points to canâ€™t be mutated .
//The mutability of the cache reference is not visible outside the memoizedIsPrime function . Thus, it is a pure function and we are not violating referential transparency. Cache updation is done ONLY by the function returned by memoizedIsPrime (which forms a closure over the cache).
//isPrime is defined as a val since we only want one instance of the cache. If we define it as using def, every call to it will result into a new instance of the cache and we will not achieve memoization.
